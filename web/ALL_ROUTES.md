# 5WH API Route Inventory

This master document lists all current Express routes grouped by base path. Where two mounts serve the same router (e.g. `/api/app` and `/app/fetch`), endpoints are equivalent. Update this file whenever routes change.

Legend:
- Auth: Public | Auth | Editor | Admin (cascading: Admin implies editor access where coded)
- Params: Path parameters shown with `:`; query parameters noted qualitatively
- Notes: Special behaviors, rate limits, fallbacks

## Unused / Empty
- `routes/advertisements.js` currently empty (placeholder) â€“ ensure removal or implement.

---
## Security / Hardening TODOs
- Protect news fetch & scraping endpoints with at least editor auth.
- Replace static mobile token with issued JWT per device.
- Add rate limiting to notification test endpoints (public) to avoid abuse.
- Persist notification device tokens & history in database.
